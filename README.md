5. **Platform Deployment**
   - Deploy the system on a server for broader public availability.

## Future Project Plan üîÆ

Following is what the future developers can add! :

1. Create a dynamic movie list instead of using an existing movie csv file.
2. Build a new feature that exhibits diversity across genres, casting choices, and different production styles.
3. Enhancing the user profile page.


Note: Our system can be virtually tested through Github Actions inbuilt feature of build and test queries using python.

Make sure you taste your own medicine first and take into account other peoples familiarity with the system before you design your tests.

## Working üì±

- Below working displays the system also evaluates movie attributes such as genre, cast, director, and user-generated reviews. 
- By combining these user-specific data and film characteristics, the recommender system employs machine learning to generate tailored movie recommendations.
- This enables users to discover new films that align with their individual tastes, making the movie-watching experience more enjoyable and engaging. 
- Furthermore, recommender systems often employ a feedback loop, where users' interactions and feedback help refine the recommendations over time, ensuring that the suggestions remain relevant.
